I joined today's Zuitt open house bootcamp to level up my skills and knowledge by  learning from what the workshop could offer which I can say is really helpful. I plan to work in the IT industry but being a newbie is struggle for not knowing where to start and how to do things. Workshops like this  teaching what tools are used, how they are used, and how they work are excellent guide for beginners like me. What's good about this session is that it is also free despite being hands on so I'm trying to learn as much as I can in hopes that I can apply what I learned on my own even without a guide.
